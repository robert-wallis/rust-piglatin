// Convert strings to pig latin.
//      The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word
//      and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.”
//      Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead
//      (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”).
//      Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
